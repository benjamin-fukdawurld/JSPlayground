# React tic-tac-toe

## The react tutorial from the official documentation

This project has been created using `react-create-app`.  

For npm command check the [README](./README.md).

## First attempt

My first attempt was to implement the game without reading the tutorial.
> I know, I am a tough guy, I think I know so much about react I don't need the tutorial.  
I am just kidding guys

You can see the code of the first attempt in index.js in this commit: [`29ae4a3`](https://github.com/benjamin-fukdawurld/JSPlayground/commit/29ae4a39084b5a55ef6612940e58aeb476f33a5d)

Ok guys, I have read the whole tutorial but once I have done implementing my first version, there was not that much to do anymore to match the official tutorial's code.
Technically, some part of the code was different but that was not that significant, let say "taste and flavor".  
Give me your opinion about the code.
