# React tic-tac-toe

## The react tutorial from the official documentation

This project has been created using `react-create-app`.  

For npm command check the [README](./README.md).

## First attempt

My first attempt was to implement the game without reading the tutorial.
> I know, I am a tough guy, I think I know so much about react I don't need the tutorial.  
I am just kidding guys

You can see the code of the first attempt in index.js in this commit: [`29ae4a3`](https://github.com/benjamin-fukdawurld/JSPlayground/commit/29ae4a39084b5a55ef6612940e58aeb476f33a5d)
