# React calculator

## A calculator inspired by ubuntus calculator

This project has been created using `react-create-app`.  

For npm commands check the [README](./README.md).

## The project

The point is to create a calculator similar to ubuntus calculator.

At first we will implement only the basic layout of the calculator.

>As the point is not to implement a math parser we will use [Math.js](https://mathjs.org) to do the maths...

Ok at this point ([commit: 7bcca44](https://github.com/benjamin-fukdawurld/JSPlayground/commit/7bcca44194188bbf16cbbfe3863da64c860a1579)) the project is not perfect but the calculator works quite well, the look and feel is quite similar, there is a little more styling to do especialy on the history and the mode selector but I think there is no need to spend more time on this project as we have learn all we needed to do it.

So, let's say "Job's done!"
