# My React journey

Here star my react journey

> There is only 1 way to learn coding: **coding**.  
So how are we going to learn React.js ?  
I am 100% sure you've guessed, **conding projects** !

## Our first project

Our first project will simply be the project described on [react's tutorial page](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).  
It is a tic-tac-toe game. As simple as it is it will be very interesting to start with it to play with react.

Let's see how we do it in the dedicated [file](./tic-tac-toe/tic-tac-toe.md)

## Lets go for other projects

Now that's we have done a bit of react let's go deeper.

To begin continue our journey we will implement the projects suggested in this [list](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/react-project-ideas-topics-beginners)

To start a bit softly we will begin with the calculator project.

## The Calculator

To start with the simplest project of the list we will implement the calculator.
The goal is to create a calculator inspired of ubuntus calculator.

Check the dedicated [page](./calculator/calculator.md)

## GitHub issue page clone

Now, let's play tith GitHub API and create a clone for GitHub issues.  
The goal is just to make a frontend similar to GitHub's page, the scope is just to display the data in the same way git does, the interaction is not meant to be equivalent.
