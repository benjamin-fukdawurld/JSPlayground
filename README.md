---

this repository is my walkthrough to js technologies, particularily MERN stack.

> The history might be a mess and the code will obviously increasing in terms of quality and in continuous improvement

## Where do we start ?
At the moment of starting the project, I have basic knowledges on HTML5 and CSS3 (very basic for CSS as I am not really familiar to web dev and frontend), I am experienced with Javascript (I have worked 2 years on a C++ & JavaScript project for SAP).

On December, 4th 2020 I have played a little with Node.js, Express.js, React.js, Mongo DB and Material UI.

Now that I have discovered the MERN stack the dirty way I will dive deeper in the technologies to go from zero to hero on web development.
